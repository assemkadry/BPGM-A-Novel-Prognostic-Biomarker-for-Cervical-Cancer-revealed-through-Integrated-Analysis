# BPGM-NILES-Conference

**Bulk_Libraries.R:** This script installs and loads multiple packages for bulk RNA-Seq analysis and visualization

**Bulk_DE.R:** This script performs bulk RNA-Seq analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, differential expression analysis, visualization, and gene set enrichment analysis.

**Bulk_Survival_Analysis.R:** This script performs bulk RNA-Seq analysis, including survival analysis, Wilcoxon test, and expression plotting.

**Bulk_Manual Plotting (K.).R:** This script generates a scatterplot of BPGM expressions across all cancer types in the TCGA and GTEx datasets. It includes mean lines and customized labels using the ggplot2 library.

**Bulk_TCGA_GTEx (OncoDB):** This script generates a boxplot of BPGM expressions across all cancer types in the TCGA and GTEx datasets.

**scRNA_Libraries.R:** This script installs and loads multiple packages for single cell RNA-Seq analysis and visualization

**scRNA_Full_Analysis.R:** The script performs scRNA-seq analysis using the Seurat package in R, including data preprocessing, quality control, clustering, and cell type annotation.
